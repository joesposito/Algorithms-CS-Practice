# CS Practice Code
This is a repo for code I've completed for various algorithms and topics related to Computer Science.

## Inversions

This program prints a permutation of length n with k inversions.

## Ramanujan

This program returns whether or not a number is a Ramanujan number (can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in two different ways).

## SortingAlgorithms

A personal implementation of various sorting algorithms in Java, including bubble sort, mergesort and quicksort.

## MatchingParentheses
A program that reads a text file and determines if the collection of all parentheses/brackets are valid in the file.

## Coffee Machine
A project I used to learn more about OOP with exception handling, reading input, class structure and access modifiers.
